---

# goals

* A very opiniated manual on how to build a web app

* self-reliance: I can do this!*

*or find the resources who knows.

---

# picking a technology

* i picked elixir, which I know a bit

---

# phoenix & elixir

* Phoenix: the Rails web framework for Elixir
* phoenixframework.org

---

# drawing a design

* i downloaded sketch
* drew up something that i thought looked pretty cool

---

# implementing the design

* i know some basic html and css
* mostly fiddling around and googling things

---

# interlude: a note on motivation

* i registered this talk to help me finish the app
* what motivates you to get stuff done?

---

# deploying to heroku

* heroku is a platform that let's you easily deploy web applications
* has pre-made templates and configurations

---

# continuous deployment with Travis CI

* travis CI for building the code and running tests
* but one can also set it up to DEPLOY code
* can be a bit fiddly, but very nice once it's done

---

# domain setup

* in preparation for this i registered my first domain
* learning about dns

---

# getting some users & feedback

* a week ago i tweeted
* got some feedback

---

# what's actually important?

* you are smart and you can learn things!
* shipping an app will make you feel confident & productive
* --done-- shipped is better than perfect!
