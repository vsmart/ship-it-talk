# Ship it!
## Building an elixir web app from first commit to Live

A software tale by Franka @franschm

---

### This is what it looks like

---

## Part 1 : Ship it! - The Why
## Part 2 : How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - The What & How
## Part 3 : Take-aways


---

## Part 1 :
### Ship it! - The Why

---

# Wait, what is shipping?

 [ insert awkward lesbian couple joke ]

---
# Wait, what is shipping?

- to ship [in software development]:

  means "to publish or distribute software"

---

## Taking on ownership of a full project (product, design, dev, ops, marketing, ...) can force you to fill in those "grey areas" and force yourself to overcome fear of new things.

---

## Self-reliance: I can do this!*

... or find the resources from someone who does.

## Satisfaction of shipping a thing

---

# Picking a "thing"

It doesn't have to be a web app. You could build:

 * a mobile game
 * a vegan recipe blog
 * an online resistance reading club
 * ... a small, completable thing

---

## "I want to learn all the things!"

vs

## "I want to become really great at this one thing!"

---

## The (problematic) myth of
# The "full-stack" wizard

![stack of pancakes](images/pancakes.jpg)

---

## The (problematic) myth of

# The lonely software wolf

### In summary:

### Part 2
## How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - What & How

### An experience report

---

---

# [ ] Why deleting tweets?

* I like tweeting
* I like privacy
* I could use a thing that deletes tweets

idea: build an app that can delete tweets!

---

# [ ] Picking a tech stack

* do you want to learn a new (to you) technology?
* do you just want to build a thing?

---

# Elixir Lang

* functional language that runs on the Erlang VM
* Erlang known for high concurrency & performance
* Ruby-style syntax

![Elixir Lang logo](images/elixir.png)

---

```
def hello_world do
  IO.puts "Hello World!"
end

```
---

```
def handle_tweets do
   fetch_tweets
   |> filter_for_date
   |> delete_tweets
end

```
---

# Phoenix Webframework

* a framework to write web applications in elixir
* heavily inspired by Rails
* phoenixframework.org

![Phoenix Framework Logo](images/phoenix.png)

---

### How to twitter?

* something something oauth2 ?

---

# "I am __________ on Twitter."

---

# Drawing a design

* I downloaded sketch
* drew up something that i thought looked pretty cool

---

# Implementing the design

* I know some basic html and css
* Mostly fiddling around and googling things
* and a lot of help from my friends

---
## Now let's deploy it!

* Heroku is a platform that let's you easily deploy web applications
* has pre-made templates and configurations

---

## Deployment and Continuous Delivery

* continous integration with travis
* continous deployment with travis?
---
* travis CI for building the code and running tests
* but one can also set it up to DEPLOY code
* can be a bit fiddly, but very nice once it's done

---

![screenshot of travis yml](images/travis.png)

* configuring this is fiddly at best
* there are good docs that help

---

## A note on tests

* I don't really have any. Sometimes that's ok.

* I do have a great twitter test account: @do_u_like_trees

---
# brief interlude: a note on motivation

![github contribution graph](images/github.png)

* what helps you to get stuff done?

---

# Domain setup

* choose your domain [ ]
* choose a provider [ ]
* read up on zone files! [ ]

---

## my zone file

![zone file](images/zone-file.png)

pro tip: `dig google.com any` to look at other people's configuration!

---

## a caveat on zone file versions

![zone file](images/versions.png)

Feature Requests

* user feedback

(reminder: ... http://delete-your-tweets.franka.tech)

---

### Feature Requests

## SSL support

---

## Part 3
# Take-aways
### aka what's actually important?

---

* the app works, I consider it "shipped"!

* you are smart and you can learn things!

* shipping a thing will make you feel confident & productive
* --done-- shipped is better than perfect!
