\#3 the importance of shipping a thing

---

# what is shipping?

 [ insert awkward lesbian couple joke ]

---
# what is shipping?

to ship [in software development]:

    to publish or distribute software

---
# picking a "thing"

* you will get many of the same benefits if you build

 * a game
 * a cooking blog
 * literally anything you can think of

---

# goal 1: A very opiniated manual on how to build a web app

Or how I build delete-your-tweets

---

# pick an idea

* i like tweeting
* i like privacy
* i could use a thing that deletes tweets

idea: build an app that can delete tweets!

---

# picking a tech stack

* do you want to learn a new (to you) technology?
* do you just want to build a thing?

---

# Elixir Lang

* elixir is a functional language that runs on beam, the Erlang VM
* syntax is very similar to Ruby
* "...leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems"

[ insert elixir logo ]

```
def hello_world do
  IO.puts "Hello World!"
end
```

---

# phoenix webframework

* a framework to write MVC web applications in elixir
* heavily inspired by Rails
* phoenixframework.org

[ insert phoenix logo ]

---

# drawing a design

* i downloaded sketch
* drew up something that i thought looked pretty cool

---

# implementing the design

* i know some basic html and css
* mostly fiddling around and googling things

---

# interlude: a note on motivation

* i registered this talk to help me finish the app
* what motivates you to get stuff done?

---

# deploying to heroku

* heroku is a platform that let's you easily deploy web applications
* has pre-made templates and configurations

---

# continuous deployment with Travis CI

* travis CI for building the code and running tests
* but one can also set it up to DEPLOY code
* can be a bit fiddly, but very nice once it's done

---

# domain setup

* in preparation for this i registered my first domain
* learning about dns

---

# getting some users & feedback

* a week ago i tweeted
* got some feedback

---

# what's actually important?

* you are smart and you can learn things!
* shipping an app will make you feel confident & productive
* --done-- shipped is better than perfect!
