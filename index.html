# Ship it!
## Building an elixir web app from first commit to Live

A software tale by Franka @franschm

---

## Part 1 : Ship it! - The Why
## Part 2 : How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - The What & How
## Part 3 : Take-aways

---

## Part 1 :
### Ship it! - The Why

---
# Wait, what is shipping?

### to ship [in software development]:

### ... means "to publish or distribute software"

---

## Taking on ownership of a full project (product, design, dev, ops, marketing, ...) can force you to fill in those "grey areas" and force yourself to overcome fear of new things.

---

## Self-reliance: I can do this!*

... or find the resources from someone who does.

---

# Picking a "thing"

It doesn't have to be a web app. You could build:

 * a mobile game
 * a vegan recipe blog
 * an online resistance reading club
 * ... a small, completable thing

---

## "I want to learn all the things!"

vs

## "I want to become really great at this one thing!"

---

## The (problematic) myth of
# The "full-stack" wizard

---

## The (problematic) myth of

# The lonely software wolf

### Part 2
## How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - What & How

### An experience report

![screenshot of delete-your-tweets](images/delete-your-tweets.png)

---

# [ ] Why deleting tweets?

* I like tweeting
* I like privacy
* I could use a thing that deletes tweets

idea: build an app that can delete tweets!

---

# [ ] Picking a tech stack

* do you want to learn a new (to you) technology?
* do you just want to build a thing?

---

# Elixir Lang

* functional language that runs on the Erlang VM
* Erlang known for high concurrency & performance
* Ruby-style syntax

# Phoenix Webframework

* a framework to write web applications in elixir
* heavily inspired by Rails

# "I am _____________ on Twitter."

### extwitter: elixir client library for Twitter

#### provides a handy abstraction over the Twitter REST api

e.g.:

```
ExTwitter.user_timeline


ExTwitter.destroy_status

```
