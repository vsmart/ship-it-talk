# Ship it!
## Building an elixir web app from first commit to Live

A software tale by Franka @franschm

---

## Part 1 : Ship it! - The Why
## Part 2 : How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - The What & How
## Part 3 : Take-aways

---

## Part 1 :
### Ship it! - The Why

---
# Wait, what is shipping?

- to ship [in software development]:

  means "to publish or distribute software"

---

## Taking on ownership of a full project (product, design, dev, ops, marketing, ...) can force you to fill in those "grey areas" and force yourself to overcome fear of new things.

---

## Self-reliance: I can do this!*

... or find the resources from someone who does.

---

# Picking a "thing"

It doesn't have to be a web app. You could build:

 * a mobile game
 * a vegan recipe blog
 * an online resistance reading club
 * ... a small, completable thing

---

## "I want to learn all the things!"

vs

## "I want to become really great at this one thing!"

---

## The (problematic) myth of
# The "full-stack" wizard

![stack of pancakes](images/pancakes.jpg)

---

## The (problematic) myth of

# The lonely software wolf

![wolf drawing](images/wolf.jpeg)

---

### In summary:

* Shipping a small project can:

** teach you new unexpected skills
** be very satisfying
** be fun!

---

### Part 2
## How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - What & How

### An experience report

---

![screenshot of delete-your-tweets](images/delete-your-tweets.png)

---

# [ ] Why deleting tweets?

* I like tweeting
* I like privacy
* I could use a thing that deletes tweets

idea: build an app that can delete tweets!

---

# [ ] Picking a tech stack

* do you want to learn a new (to you) technology?
* do you just want to build a thing?

---

# Elixir Lang

* functional language that runs on the Erlang VM
* Erlang known for high concurrency & performance
* Ruby-style syntax

# "I am _____________ on Twitter."

### extwitter: elixir client library for Twitter

```
bla bla

```
---

# Drawing a design

* I downloaded sketch
* drew up something that i thought looked pretty cool

---

# Implementing the design

* I know some basic html and css
* Mostly fiddling around and googling things
* and a lot of help from my friends

# brief interlude: a note on side projects

---
## Now let's deploy it!

* Heroku is a platform that let's you easily deploy web applications
* has pre-made templates and configurations

---

## Deployment and Continuous Delivery

* continous integration with travis
* next step: continous *deployment* with travis?

---

![screenshot of travis yml](images/travis.png)

* configuring this is fiddly at best
* there are good docs that help

---

---

## A note on tests

* No unit tests. That's ok though.
* I do have a great twitter test account: @do_u_like_trees
