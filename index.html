# Ship it!
## Building an elixir web app from first commit to Live

A software tale by Franka @franschm

---

### This is what it looks like

![screenshot of delete-your-tweets](images/delete-your-tweets.png)

---

## Part 1 : Ship it! - The Why
## Part 2 : How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - The What & How
## Part 3 : Take-aways


---

## Part 1 :
### Ship it! - The Why

---

# Wait, what is shipping?

 [ insert awkward lesbian couple joke ]

---
# Wait, what is shipping?

- to ship [in software development]:

  means "to publish or distribute software"

---

## Taking on ownership of a full project (product, design, dev, ops, marketing, ...) can force you to fill in those "grey areas" and force yourself to overcome fear of new things.

---

## Self-reliance: I can do this!*

... or find the resources from someone who does.

## Satisfaction of shipping a thing

---

# Picking a "thing"

It doesn't have to be a web app. You could build:

 * a mobile game
 * a vegan recipe blog
 * an online resistance reading club
 * ... a small, completable thing

---

## "I want to learn all the things!"

vs

## "I want to become really great at this one thing!"

---

## The (problematic) myth of
# The "full-stack" wizard

![stack of pancakes](images/pancakes.jpg)

---

## The (problematic) myth of
# The lonely software wolf

---

### In summary:

### Part 2
## How I built 'delete-your-tweets' - What & How

### An experience report

---

![screenshot of delete-your-tweets](images/delete-your-tweets.png)

---

# [ ] pick an idea

* I like tweeting
* I like privacy
* I could use a thing that deletes tweets

idea: build an app that can delete tweets!

---

# [ ] picking a tech stack

* do you want to learn a new (to you) technology?
* do you just want to build a thing?

---

# elixir lang

* elixir is a functional language that runs on beam, the Erlang VM
* syntax is very similar to Ruby
* "...leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems"

[ insert elixir logo ]

```
def hello_world do
  IO.puts "Hello World!"
end
```

---

# phoenix webframework

* a framework to write MVC web applications in elixir
* heavily inspired by Rails
* phoenixframework.org

[ insert phoenix logo ]

---

# a phoenix app

* controllers, routing, templates, views

(... and channels, sockets, etc...)

---

# [ ] prototype

---

# github, travis, tests ???

---

# deploying to heroku

* heroku is a platform that let's you easily deploy web applications
* has pre-made templates and configurations

---

# a note on tests

* i don't have any. that's ok (sometimes)

---

# drawing a design

* i downloaded sketch
* drew up something that i thought looked pretty cool

---

# implementing the design

* i know some basic html and css
* mostly fiddling around and googling things

---

# interlude: a note on motivation

* i registered this talk to help me finish the app
* what motivates you to get stuff done?

---

# continuous deployment with Travis CI

* travis CI for building the code and running tests
* but one can also set it up to DEPLOY code
* can be a bit fiddly, but very nice once it's done

---

# domain setup

* very big pain !!!
* in preparation for this i registered my first domain
* learning about dns

---

# getting some users

* a week ago i tweeted
* got some feedback

---

# what's actually important?

* you can delete tweets

* you are smart and you can learn things!
* shipping an app will make you feel confident & productive
* --done-- shipped is better than perfect!
